title: "Lecture 22: Mini-batch SGD and Complexity-Variance Tradeoff"
tldr: "SGD - Part II"
stat: lec
# for lectures stat: lec
description: We see that full-batch training and basic SGD describe the two extreme points of a spectrum. We can balance them using the idea of mini-bach training. This leads to a complexity-variance tradeoff.
