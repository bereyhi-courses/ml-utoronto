title: "Lecture 41: Backpropagation  Through CNNs"
tldr: "Training CNNs"
stat: lec
# for lectures stat: lec
description: We learn how to backpropagate on various layers of a CNN. Interestingly, backpropagation through convolutional layers is again described by convolution. This makes the implementation of backpropagation over CNN very efficient.
