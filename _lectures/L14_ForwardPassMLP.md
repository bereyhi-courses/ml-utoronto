tldr: "Forward Pass"

# for lectures stat: lec
description: We start with out first architecture, i.e., fully-connected FNNs, which are also known as MLPs. We try to understand how these NNs computationally learn what we look for from the input, i.e., how does the inference occur? This is computationally done by what we call forward propagation of data in the NN.
