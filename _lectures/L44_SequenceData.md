title: "Lecture 44: Processing Sequence Data"
tldr: "Seq Models"
stat: lec
# for lectures stat: lec
description: We study sequence data and their processing by NNs. We see that due to temporal connection, we cannot process them separately. At the same time, the one-shot processing is not feasible. We hence need to develop a sequence model.
