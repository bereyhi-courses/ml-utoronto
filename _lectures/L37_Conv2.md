title: "Lecture 37: Padding and Multichannel Convolution"
tldr: "Convolution II"
stat: lec
# for lectures stat: lec
description: We further learn about zero padding, which helps us flexibly play with the output dimensions. We then extend the basic 2D convolution to the multi-channel case, where a multi-channel input is processed to a multi-channel output.
